SOW2 Deliverable
================

This folder contains all the code developed for Myant by ABR
as part of SOW 2.

Running with the TFLite Simulator
---------------------------------
The easiest way to run the model in Python is with the TFLite simulator.
The code for facilitating this is all contained in this root folder.
The entry point is `main.py`. Running this script will execute the model
on the data specified in `main.py`.

NOTE: This is currently only the chest model, but this code will be extended
to the waist model as well in the future.

The results will be stored in the `results` folder. By default, the model
will look for an `outputs.npy` file in `results`, and if it exists will
use those outputs rather than re-running the model.

NOTE: Anyone wishing to re-run the model on the data should move the
results folder to another location (e.g. `results-original`) so that
the script will create a new `results` folder and re-run everything.


Running with the C++ Library on CPU
-----------------------------------
The C++ library used for running on the pod can also be compiled for the CPU.
This will give results that should match exactly what will be computed
by the pod. Currently, this code uses the same small segment of test data
that is used by the code for running on the pod. However, it could easily
be modified to read and write data to a file for large-scale testing.

To run this model, use the `pod/run-cpu.sh` script.


Running with the C++ Library on Pod
-----------------------------------
To run the pod model on an actual device (i.e. Nordic dev board), we use
the same code but compiled for ARM.

Use the `pod/run.sh` script (with the environment variables in that script
modified for your machine) to compile and run on the Nordic board.

See the `pod/README.md` file for more information.


Recompiling the pod libraries
-----------------------------
We have provided the source code for the pod libraries in `pod/pod-lib`.
The README file there contains more information, but it should be
a straightforward process.
